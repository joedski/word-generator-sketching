Word Generator Sketching
========================

Just sketching some ideas for a word generator thingamabob, random dicking about while playing with various ideas.  No real structure here.

Stuff
-----

Use NodeJS to run this.

Currently depends on:

- CoffeeScript, preferably installed globally.
- Minimist.

Legal
-----

Code is released under the WTFPL.  Yes, you can even claim the code as your own if you wish.  That would be rude, but you could do it.  The only restriction is that you must change the name.  To, like, Not Word Generator Sketching, or Word Generator Sketcheringering.  Or something else different.
